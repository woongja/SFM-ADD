# Balanced Training Strategy:
# Each mini-batch contains:
#   - 10 augmentation types × 2 (bonafide + spoof) = 20 samples
#   - 2 clean (1 bonafide + 1 spoof) = 2 samples
#   Total = 22 samples per batch
#
# This ensures:
#   1. All augmentation types are present in every batch
#   2. Balanced bonafide/spoof ratio (1:1)
#   3. Model sees diverse augmentation in each update
