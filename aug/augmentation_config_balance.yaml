# Note: Each augmentation samples parameters from wide ranges
# This allows the model to see diverse augmentation intensities
# SNR ranges cover:
#   - Light (Stage 2): SNR 25-35 dB
#   - Medium (Stage 3): SNR 15-25 dB
#   - Strong (Stage 4): SNR 5-15 dB
# By using min_snr_db=5, max_snr_db=35, we cover all intensities
